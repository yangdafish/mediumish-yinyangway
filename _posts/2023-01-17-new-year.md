title: Celebrating Chinese New Year with Traditional Medicine
---

Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is a time of celebration and reunion for families and friends. It is also a time when many people turn to traditional medicine to promote health and well-being in the new year.

In Chinese traditional medicine (CTM), the spring season is associated with the liver and gallbladder, which are believed to be the organs that are most active during this time of year. The liver is responsible for the smooth flow of qi (energy) and blood throughout the body, while the gallbladder is responsible for storing and releasing bile for digestion.

To support the health of the liver and gallbladder, CTM practitioners recommend a diet that is high in foods that are believed to nourish these organs. These include bitter greens, such as dandelion, kale, and collard greens, as well as fruits and vegetables that are high in antioxidants, such as citrus fruits and dark, leafy greens.

Acupuncture and herbal medicine are also popular ways to support the health of the liver and gallbladder during Chinese New Year. Acupuncture can help to promote the smooth flow of qi and blood throughout the body, while herbal medicine can help to nourish and support the liver and gallbladder.

In addition to supporting the health of the liver and gallbladder, traditional Chinese medicine also recommends taking time to rest and relax during Chinese New Year. This can include activities such as meditation, yoga, and tai chi, which can help to promote a sense of balance and well-being.

In conclusion, Chinese New Year is a time when many people turn to traditional Chinese medicine to promote health and well-being in the new year. Eating a diet that is high in foods that nourish the liver and gallbladder, practicing traditional Chinese medicine, and taking time to rest and relax are all ways to support the health of the body and mind during this special time of year.
